# Surveys Website
The website was developed using different programming languages and software. For the front end, I used HTML(Bootstrap), CCS, and JavaScript(JQuery)
. For the back end, I used Php, and SQL for the database. Bootstrap studio was used to develop all the pages for the website; 
The main advantages of Bootstrap is it allows the developer to build a responsive website easily without the headache to specify all the different screen sizes.
